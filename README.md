# ShipShooterEx

A simple vertical shooting game.
Make your ship alive as long as possible by avoiding the rushing spaceships ready to suicide just to destroy your ship.
You can shoot them but it takes time to reload.
You may choose from the two spaceship in the menu, one has wide range attack but slow movespeed and the other
has narrow attack with fast movespeed.
Your score will be the number of spaceships destroyed.
Have Fun!
